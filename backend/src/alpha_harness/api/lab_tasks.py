"""Tasks: what the labs added, run from one place.

A lab only adds a task. Here a task runs: it waits until its cores fit in the free slots,
runs until its simulations are spent, across days if it has to, and can be paused,
stopped, changed or removed. Search Lab, Template Lab and Evolution Lab add scheduler.
