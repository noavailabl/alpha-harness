"""Tools: helpers that act on an Alpha the consultant already has.

The Settings Sampler re-runs one proven expression everywhere BRAIN will accept it. The
Correlation Breaker does the opposite — it holds the settings still and re-shapes the
expression, for an Alpha the platform says is already in the production pool. The
Submission Planner then decides which of the results are worth submitting, and in what order.
Neither simulates on its own: previews only read, and queueing hands work to the scheduler
like any lab.
