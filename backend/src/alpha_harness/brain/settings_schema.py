"""Resolving ``OPTIONS /simulations`` into usable settings options.

The schema returned by the platform is *recursive*. A field's ``choices`` is either a flat
list::

    {"choices": [{"value": "EQUITY", "label": "Equity"}]}

or a dependency node keyed by the field it depends on::

    {"choices": {"instrumentType": {"EQUITY": {"region": {"USA": [ ...universes... ]}}}}}

So the legal universes depend on the region, which depends on the instrument type.
Hardcoding any of it would show users options their account cannot run.
