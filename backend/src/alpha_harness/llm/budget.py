"""Tracking what each key has spent.

No provider publishes a remaining-quota endpoint, so the only way to rotate keys sensibly
is to count locally, against the limits the user set up. Two windows, tracked differently
because they behave differently:

* **Requests per minute** is a sliding sixty-second window, kept in memory: losing it on a
  restart costs at most one minute of over-caution.
* **Requests per day** is a calendar day and *must* survive a restart, or a spent key looks
  fresh and every rotation walks into a ``429``.

Tokens are recorded for the record, never limited on: no count made here matches the
provider's own.

**The day boundary is the model's own.** Providers do not agree on when a day starts, Google
at midnight Pacific and OpenRouter at midnight UTC, so each model carries the time zone its
user named, and a day counted on the wrong clock hands a budget back hours early or late.

Accounting is deliberately conservative — a request is refused here when it *would* exceed
a limit — because a local refusal can name another key or model, and a ``429`` cannot.
