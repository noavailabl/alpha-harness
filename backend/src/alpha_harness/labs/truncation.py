"""Truncation Agent: a truncation for each market, from fixed rules on its region, delay and

BRAIN recommends 0.05 to 0.1 and fails an Alpha whose largest weight in one stock reaches 10%,
or 8% in USA for consultants, so nothing here goes above 0.08. Within that, a broad universe
gets room for conviction, while a narrow one, a multi-country region or Delay 0 is held
tighter so a few names cannot carry the book.
