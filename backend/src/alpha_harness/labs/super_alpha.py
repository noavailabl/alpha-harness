"""Super Alpha Lab: SuperAlphas built from your own submitted Alphas, ready to submit.

A SuperAlpha is a selection expression, ranking every submitted ``ACTIVE`` Alpha of the
region and delay and keeping the top ``selectionLimit``, and a combo expression, weighting
the kept Alphas each day. Nothing here searches either expression: SuperAlpha simulations
are slow and BRAIN runs three at a time, so the lab crosses a small library of
economically grounded selections with proven weighting schemes, each at two decays to land
Turnover inside the 2% to 40% a SuperAlpha must clear, and lets BRAIN's own checks say
which are submittable.

Every selection caps each Alpha's operators at 8,000 / limit: BRAIN warns rather than
fails past 8,000 operators in all, and drops what does not fit.
