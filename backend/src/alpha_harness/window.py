"""Showing the app: in a window of its own where the default browser can draw one, else a tab.

A Chromium browser started with ``--app`` opens a page as a standalone window — its own
taskbar or Dock icon, no tabs, no address bar — which is the whole difference between a web
page and a desktop app to the person using it. Only the *default* browser is ever used, and
in its ordinary profile: a different browser, or a private profile, would start the app with
none of the drafts and settings the reader's browser already keeps for it. Anything else —
Firefox, Safari, a browser that cannot be found — gets a tab, exactly as before.

Standard library only: the launcher keeps a copy of this, and must run with no venv at all.
