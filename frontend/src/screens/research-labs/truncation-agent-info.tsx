        <p>Truncation sets the maximum weight of one stock in the Alpha.</p>
        <p>
          For example, Truncation <span className="num text-ink">0.08</span> lets one stock hold a
          maximum of 8% of the Alpha.
        </p>
        <p>
          BRAIN fails the Weight test if one stock has too much weight. For consultants, the limit
          is 8% in USA and 10% in other regions.
        </p>
      </InfoSection>

      <InfoSection title="Why one value is not always correct">
        <p>
          A Universe with many stocks can use a higher Truncation. The Alpha still holds many
          stocks.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Universe with few stocks needs a lower Truncation. If not, a small number of stocks can
          control the Alpha.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Region with many countries needs a lower Truncation. Then a problem in one country
          cannot control the Alpha.
        </p>
        <p>
          An Alpha at Delay 0 trades more. A lower Truncation decreases the risk from one stock.
